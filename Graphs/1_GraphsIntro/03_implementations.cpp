// adjacency list
//we represent graph as array of linked list
//array and linked list
//for weighted array and list of pair
//adjacency map
//adjacency map --> array of map
//adjacency matrix
//adj[i][j]
//Incidence Matrix
//V*E matrix where v is no of vertices and e is no of edges
//here we name edges and see which verices are there based on 0 and 1
